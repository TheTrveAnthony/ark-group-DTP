# ark-group-DTP

This folder contains what I did during my internship with the ark group in Aachen, Germany in 2017. The aim of the project was to make an error detector on printed fabrics. I had to make several algorithm n order to detect those errors, and I took advantage of that mission to experimnt machine learning for the first.
Note : You won't be able to run the code you'll find here because you'll need fabrics images in order to do it, which I don't have anymore.
